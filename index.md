# Core Portal Lifecycle & Deployment Procedures (CPLDP)

Detailed documentation on the comprehensive lifecycle of a TACC ACI-WMA Core v2 Portal. This includes the workflows required to plan, establish, provision, configure and deploy a portal (with a checklist of explicit, discrete actions to convert into JIRA tasks) as well as detailed procedures for portal customization (via container and application integration), maintenance, backups, archiving and sunsetting.

## Quick Start

**TL;DR** - Take me to the [Deployment Checklist](pages/checklist.md) now!

## Purpose

This documentation describes every step that should be taken before, during and after a new portal is established. It should be referenced throughout all phases of the portal's lifecycle.
