# JIRA Usage

When deploying a new portal, it can be difficult to track the many individual tasks and their status, especially if the tasks are assigned to multiple team members who are working in parallel.

In order to facilitate the tracking of deployment procedures, we recommend the following strategy:

1. Create a JIRA `Task` under the JIRA Project for each _Phase_ of the portal deployment lifecycle.
2. Create a JIRA `Task` for each _Action_ listed under each _Phase_ in the [Lifecycle Procedures Checklist](pages/checklist.md)].
3. Link each _Action_ `Task` to the parent _Phase_ `Task` in JIRA (e.g. `is a subtask of`).
4. Track the progress of each _Action_ `Task` and parent _Phase_ `Task` using JIRA as per usual.
