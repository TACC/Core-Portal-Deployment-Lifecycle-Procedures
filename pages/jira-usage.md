# JIRA Usage

When deploying a new portal (Subphases 6A - 6H), it can be difficult to track the many individual tasks and their status, especially if the tasks are assigned to multiple team members who are working in parallel or across multiple portal projects.

In order to facilitate the tracking of the deployment procedures, we recommend the following strategy:

1. Create a JIRA **Task** under the portal's JIRA project for each _SubPhase_ of the deployment lifecycle.
2. Create a JIRA **Task** for each _Action_ listed under each _SubPhase_.
3. Link each _Action_ **Task** to the parent _SubPhase_ **Tas** in JIRA (e.g. _is a subtask of_).
4. Track the progress of each _Action_ **Task** and the related parent _SubPhase_ **Task**.
5. Deployment will be succesful when all _Subphase_ **Tasks** have been completed.
