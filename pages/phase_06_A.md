<a id="6a-action-01"></a>

## Identify the Portal Project PI

TACC users who qualify for PI status can initiate new projects in the TACC User Portal and request resource allocations.

1. Create a TACC user account in the [TACC User Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/home) (TUP).
2. Review the new user [account request](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request) procedures.
3. Review the procedures for determining [PI eligibility](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/allocations-overview#eligibility).
4. Once a PI eligible TACC user account has been established, be sure to complete the steps for [MFA pairing](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication).

## Identify or Establish a TAS Project/Allocation

TACC portals are charged against a project that is officially recognized by the TACC Accounting System (TAS). Any computational or storage resources used by the portal on behalf of its users will be be charged against an allocation associated with the project. The project and allocation is also used to provide user access controls, job submissions and resource usage accounting activities.

1. Once the PI user account is completely setup, login to TUP and review the information on [allocation types](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/managing-allocations).
2. From TUP, the PI User can create a new project, request an allocation for the project to utilize against TACC resources and administrate the project.
3. TACC staff with appropriate access permissions can verify account status by accessing the [TAS](https://tas.tacc.utexas.edu).
4. Once the allocation request is approved, the remaining procedures for establishing a new portal can commence.

2. Select the **Projects** tab.
